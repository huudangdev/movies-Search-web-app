# Build the simple app with ReactJs hooks (trend)

Basically, the app will be able to search for movies via the **Movie DB API** and render the results to the user. The reason for building the app is just so that we can get a better understanding of using hooks in an application, which helps in understanding the role some of the hooks we will use can play in your own real-world apps. Some things are needed before we get into building the app:

- Node (â‰¥ 6).
- A cool text Editor - *Visual Code*.
- An API key from MovieDB.
- Core about ReactJs Hooks.
- Git page to deploy.
